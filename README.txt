# Residuals and Diagnostics for Multinomial Regression Models

This repository provides the code and datasets used in the paper authored by Eric A. E. Gerber and Bruce A. Craig.

## Code Files:

* `sam_gerber_craig_code.R`: The main code file containing most of the relevant code to reproduce the majority of the manuscript.
* `mln_functions.R`: This file contains the necessary functions to fit the multinomial logistic-normal model, which serves as a candidate model throughout the paper.
* `ks_sim_study.R`: This file uses parallelized code to conduct the simulation studies of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.

## Dataset Files:

* `bbs_63014_saxapahaw.xlsx`: This file contains one of the real datasets used in the paper.

Two other datasets are available via R packages:
* Forest pollen data: MM R package.
* Baseball data: Lahman R package.
